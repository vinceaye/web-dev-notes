- HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your [[HTML]] easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
- The `main` element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. 
	- Content inside the `main` element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document.
```html
<main>
  <h1>Most important content of the document</h1>
  <p>Some more important content...</p>
</main>
```
